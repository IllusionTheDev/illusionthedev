# Hey, I'm Illusion, a freelance plugin developer.

My main focus is Minecraft, since 2016, I've worked as a freelance developer on over 700 projects across several industries, ranging from server infrastructure code to complex minigame projects.

I focus on performance, scalability, and production-ready programming, and I have a strong background in server tuning and profiling. If you need someone who can operate quickly in complex, real-time scenarios, you've come to the right spot.
